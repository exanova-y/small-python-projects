**Procrastinator simulator:** My weird text game that got featured as one of the examples in CS class.
**Minin' Away:** Collatz conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) as a game of avoiding lava.
**Acacia Tree:** Acacia during sunset. Python art.

This is a sample of my projects created during grades 10 and 11.
